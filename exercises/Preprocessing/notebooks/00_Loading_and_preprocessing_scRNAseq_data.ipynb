        "\n",
        "Most scRNA-seq toolkits are written in `R` (the most famous being [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/)), but we (and a majority of machine learning / data scientists) develop our tools in `python`. Currently, [Scanpy](https://icb-scanpy.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/stable/) is the most popular toolkit for scRNA-seq analysis in `python`. However, Scanpy has a highly structured framework for data representation that is incompatible with the bulk of the `python` data science framework, e.g. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).\n",
        "\n",
        "To accommodate users of the wider `python` data analysis ecosystem, we developed `scprep` (<b>s</b>ingle <b>c</b>ell <b>prep</b>aration). `scprep` makes it easier to use the pandas / SciPy / scikit-learn ecosystem for scRNA-seq analysis. Most of `scprep` is composed of helper functions to perform tasks common to single cell data like loading counts matrices, filtering & normalizing cells by library size, and calculating common statistics. The key advantage of `scprep` is that data can be stored in Pandas DataFrames, NumPy arrays, Scipy sparse matrices, and no matter which tools you choose to interface with, _it just works_.\n",

For EB (Embriod Body) formation, cells were treated with Dispase, dissociated into small clumps and plated in non-adherent plates in media supplemented with 20% FBS, which was prescreened for EB differentiation. Samples were collected during 3-day intervals during a 27 day-long differentiation timecourse. An undifferentiated hESC sample was also included (Figure S7D). Induction of key germ layer markers in these EB cultures was validated by qPCR (data not shown). For single cell analyses, EB cultures were dissociated, FACS sorted to remove doublets and dead cells and processed on a 10x genomics instrument to generate cDNA libraries, which were then sequenced. Small scale sequencing determined that we have successfully collected data on approximately 31,000 cells equally distributed throughout the timecourse."

These unique molecules are identified using a random barcode incorporated during the first round of reverse transcription. This barcode is called a <b>U</b>nique <b>M</b>olecule <b>I</b>dentifier, and often we refer to the number unique mRNAs in a cell as the number of UMIs. To read more about UMIs, [Smith *et al.* (2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5340976/) write about how sequencing errors and PCR amplification errors lead to innaccurate quantification of UMIs/cell.\n",

Additional methods exist for trying to detect the difference between droplets containing one cell and droplets containing two cells (\"doublets\"). You can take these methods at face value or set some manual cutoffs based on your data.\n",
